# data_structures_in_C
recording the code of "NTU_DSA_2022" assignment. In this course, I implemented multiple data structures including heap, stack, linked-list and disjoint set from scratch under strict time limitation. I've also implemented several algorithms like rabin-karp algorithm and prefix infix-postfix translation.
