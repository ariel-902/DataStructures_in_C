# data_structures_in_C
Recorded the assignment code of "NTU_DSA_2022" by Professor Hsuan-Tien Lin and Professor Hsin-Mu Tsai. In this course, I implemented multiple data structures including heap, stack, linked-list and disjoint set from scratch in C under strict time limitation. I've implemented several algorithms like rabin-karp algorithm and prefix infix-postfix translation as well.
